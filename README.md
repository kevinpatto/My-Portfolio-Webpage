# My Portfolio

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This project was made to show employers an easy way to access all the projects I have worked on. With this website, an effective portfolio can be seen by employers to easily look through websites, and it serves as part of my portfolio as well. I learned a lot about CSS styling and how to turn a wireframe/reference image into a stylized webpage.
