# My Portfolio

## Description

This project was made to show employers an easy way to access all the projects I have worked on. With this website, an effective portfolio can be seen by employers to easily look through websites, and it serves as part of my portfolio as well. I learned a lot about CSS styling and how to turn a wireframe/reference image into a stylized webpage.
